# Correction Predictive Model
Final project for CSC311

Tao Zhang and I worked together on this project :)

## Introduction
Given sparse matrix representing correctness of answers of 542 students to 1774 diagnostic questions, we used kNN, IRT, Matrix Factorization, 3-PL IRT to build predictive models.

The prediction on correctness helps learning website (e.g. Khan Academy) to filter out questions that student can answer with confidence.

## Result
You can see our report in [here](https://github.com/yiyi-z/Project-CorrectionPredictiveModel/blob/main/documentation/Project%20Report.pdf) under Part B.
